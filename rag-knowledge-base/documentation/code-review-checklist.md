# Comprehensive Code Review Checklist

## Overview

This checklist provides a systematic approach to conducting thorough code reviews. Use this as a guide to ensure consistency and completeness in your review process.

## 1. Code Organization and Structure

### File Organization

- [ ] Files are logically organized into appropriate directories
- [ ] File names are descriptive and follow naming conventions
- [ ] Related functionality is grouped together
- [ ] Public and private interfaces are clearly separated

### Function and Class Structure

- [ ] Functions have a single, well-defined responsibility
- [ ] Functions are appropriately sized (typically 20-50 lines)
- [ ] Classes follow the Single Responsibility Principle
- [ ] Inheritance and composition are used appropriately

### Example Issues to Look For:

```python
# BAD: Function doing too many things
def process_user_data(user_data):
    # Validation
    if not user_data.get('email'):
        raise ValueError("Email required")

    # Processing
    user_data['email'] = user_data['email'].lower()

    # Database operations
    save_to_database(user_data)

    # Email sending
    send_welcome_email(user_data['email'])

    # Logging
    log_user_creation(user_data)

# GOOD: Separated responsibilities
def validate_user_data(user_data):
    if not user_data.get('email'):
        raise ValueError("Email required")

def normalize_user_data(user_data):
    user_data['email'] = user_data['email'].lower()
    return user_data

def create_user(user_data):
    validate_user_data(user_data)
    normalized_data = normalize_user_data(user_data)
    save_to_database(normalized_data)
    send_welcome_email(normalized_data['email'])
    log_user_creation(normalized_data)
```

## 2. Security Review

### Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] User authentication is properly implemented
- [ ] Authorization checks are present for all protected resources
- [ ] Session management is secure
- [ ] Password policies are enforced

### Input Validation

- [ ] All user inputs are validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention measures are in place
- [ ] XSS protection is implemented
- [ ] File upload security is addressed

### Sensitive Data Handling

- [ ] No hardcoded passwords or API keys
- [ ] Sensitive data is properly encrypted
- [ ] Secure communication protocols are used
- [ ] Personal data handling complies with privacy regulations

### Common Security Vulnerabilities

```python
# Check for these security issues:

# 1. Hardcoded secrets
API_KEY = "abc123secret"  # BAD
API_KEY = os.environ.get('API_KEY')  # GOOD

# 2. SQL injection
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"  # BAD
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"  # GOOD

# 3. Insecure direct object references
def get_user_profile(user_id):
    return User.objects.get(id=user_id)  # BAD - no authorization check

def get_user_profile(user_id, current_user):
    if current_user.id != user_id and not current_user.is_admin:
        raise PermissionError("Access denied")
    return User.objects.get(id=user_id)  # GOOD
```

## 3. Performance Review

### Algorithm Efficiency

- [ ] Algorithms have appropriate time complexity
- [ ] Nested loops are justified or optimized
- [ ] Data structures are chosen appropriately
- [ ] Caching is used where beneficial

### Database Performance

- [ ] Queries are optimized
- [ ] N+1 query problems are avoided
- [ ] Appropriate indexes are used
- [ ] Database connections are managed properly

### Memory Management

- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable
- [ ] Large objects are cleaned up appropriately
- [ ] Memory leaks are prevented
- [ ] Generator expressions are used for large datasets

## 4. Error Handling and Logging

### Exception Handling

- [ ] Appropriate exceptions are caught
- [ ] Exception handling doesn't hide errors
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Critical errors are logged

### Logging

- [ ] Important events are logged
- [ ] Log levels are appropriate
- [ ] Sensitive data is not logged
- [ ] Logs provide useful debugging information

### Example Error Handling:

```python
# BAD: Generic exception handling
try:
    result = process_data(data)
except:
    return "An error occurred"

# GOOD: Specific exception handling with logging
try:
    result = process_data(data)
except ValidationError as e:
    logger.warning(f"Invalid data provided: {e}")
    return {"error": "Invalid input data"}
except DatabaseError as e:
    logger.error(f"Database error in process_data: {e}")
    return {"error": "Service temporarily unavailable"}
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error in process_data: {e}")
    return {"error": "An unexpected error occurred"}
```

### Example Review Comments:

```
Good examples:
- "Consider using a set instead of list for membership testing here for O(1) lookup"
- "This could lead to SQL injection. Please use parameterized queries"
- "Great use of the factory pattern here!"

Less helpful examples:
- "This is wrong"
- "Change this"
- "I don't like this"
```
